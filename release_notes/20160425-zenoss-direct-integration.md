**New features:**

* Asq now supports direct alerting push into Zenoss for monitoring. If you are creating a new monitor, simply select the "Enable Zenoss Alerts" option that will appear at the bottom of the Asq edit screen and alerts will begin flowing to the SOC with no additional requests for setup on their end! (But keep your TSGs properly updated, plzkthx.)

* Despite the relative popularity of tab delimited files among our clients, trying to insert/paste/force a tab into the Custom Delimeter text field remained distinctly unpopular. That text field has been replaced with a much simpler drop-down.

* The Asq details page has been updated to match the edit screen.
