**New features:**

*   Asqs may now be designated as either a Monitor or Report. Monitors have error conditions and will only deliver when those conditions are met, reports will deliver data on every refresh and do not contain any mention of errors.
*   Custom email templating is now available. You may now specify the subject and body of any email. Please note that HTML in those fields will not render properly and that custom bodies will still have a relatively generic wrapper around them.
*   File delimter settings have been added to the Advanced File Options.
*   AutoSFTP integration has been added. Please note that at this time it still requires setup from BEST, so the field will show you what options exist but will be disabled for normal users.
*   Asq refreshes should now AJAX cleanly instead of forcing a screen refresh.
*   The Asq edit page has been updated with a cleaner layout.
